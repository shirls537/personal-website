                       I'm currently a rising senior at the University of California, Berkeley, pursuing a simultaneous degree in Business Administration and Data Science.
                        As an aspiring tech leader, I am passionate about the intersection between tech and business, and how we can use these two sectors to better our world.
                      Aside from data science and business, I love learning about astronomy!</p>

                            <p>I'm highly interested in learning how we can use data to produce data-driven decisions to help solve important problems. I've developed my skills as a data scientist as an undergraduate research intern at the Berkeley Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Research Center in the summer of 2020. I helped to build a cloud-based platform to help researchers apply their own algorithms to terabytes of data to search for ET. I've used JSP, HTML, and Python Flask to accomplish this. I'm currently working on an autoencoder to cluster signal data from the Green Bank Telescope to better identify patterns and pinpoint anomalies.
                            I'm also part of a data science consulting club on campus called Big Data at Berkeley; we work with companies in a variety of industries and use their data to make decisions and solve problems. My first semester there, I helped to build a model using the multiple linear regression algorithm to predict our client's churn rates.

                            <p>I love designing and building products that help solve crucial needs! I'm currently a Product Intern at PwC. I was first introduced into product management through a class I took at Berkeley. It was an incredibly valuable experience, as we had to work in teams to build a product from scratch. Our team built a guide dog handle for the blind that is more ergonomic, flexible, and comfortable than the traditional dog harnesses in the market. This helps to alleviate chronic shoulder and back pain experienced by many guide dog users. I also learned management frameworks like Agile Development & Scrum through tools like Jira.</p>

                            <p>I've been a project manager of my data science consulting club called Big Data at Berkeley for two semesters. My first client was a winery called McBride Sisters; I led my team of six consultants to create data-driven decisions to help increase their market share, create consumer profiles, and gain further insight into consumer behavior and future market potentials. My second client was Intuitive Surgical; I led my team of six consultants into a deeper dive on surgical stapler trace data by conducting physics-based anomalies, identify trends, and provide solutions to help further research and development in Da Vinci Xi Stapling. For both of these projects, my co-project manager andn I maintained weekly direct contact with our client, create a project timeline and structure, and presented both a midpoint and final deliverable.
                            What I've realized as a project manager and leading people is that I enjoy helping my team grow and develop their skills and as a person. It was an incredibly impactful and fulfilling experience to see how my co-pm and I's leadership has helped people discover their interests, passions, and goals. Currently, I am the VP of Consulting; I'm super excited to lead and shape our club's projects division and lead the project managers.</p>

                    <p>I am a huge fan of music! I play the violin, piano, and I'm currently learning the ukulele and learning how to sing. I also love to travel; we have this lifetime here on earth, so why not explore and enjoy the wonders of what our planet has to offer as much as possible?
                    You can also find me outdoors on the weekends hiking, exploring beaches, going to amusement parks, or reading in the sun.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of television shows, movies, and programs. I also love playing board games! Having been interested in fashion lately, I've recently been reading up on sustainable fashion brands and thrifting. Aside from all that, I started investing and learning more about personal finance during the huge market dip of spring 2020. Ever since, I've been keeping up with investing and learning about financial freedom!</p>
